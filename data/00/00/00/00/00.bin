  |   Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a gothic horror action           |
  |   side-scrolling RPG set in 18th century England. A paranormal force    |
  |   has summoned a demon-infested castle, revealing crystal shards        |
  |   infused with tremendous magical power.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Play as Miriam, an orphan scarred by an alchemist's curse which       |
  |   slowly crystallizes her body. To save humanity, and herself in the    |
  |   process, Miriam must fight through the castle and defeat the          |
  |   summoner, Gebel.                                                      |

  |   Collect, craft and unlock a vast array of weapons, equipment and      |
  |   loot to defeat the countless minions and bosses of hell that await!   |

  |   The Nintendo Switch Improvement update is live! We know it took a     |
  |   while to get this update to you and we are very appreciative of       |
  |   your patience.                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There are four areas of improvement in version 1.03: Input Lag,       |
  |   Visual Quality, Crashes and Load Times.                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   First oﬀ, input lag has been eliminated throughout the game. You      |
  |   will ﬁnd the controls more responsive, making the game easier to      |
  |   navigate and enemies easier to ﬁght. There are still a few areas      |
  |   that need optimizing that will be included in update 1.04.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Overall stability has been improved throughout the game. We have      |
  |   addressed several speciﬁc situations that have been causing           |
  |   crashes, most notably when reading books from a bookcase.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Loading times have been reduced signiﬁcantly, by up to 70% but        |
  |   there are still areas we'd like to improve. We will keep working to   |
  |   improve this on a room-by-room basis.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Even more improvements are coming in update 1.04, so keep an eye on   |
  |   the news for that announcement!                                       |
